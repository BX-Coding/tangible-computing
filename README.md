# Tangible Computing
[BX Coding's](bxcoding.org) tangible computing project aims to make computing more accessible for K-5 learners through a physical brick-based programming language. This page is a living document of the project's research, design, and development.

## Project Goals
1. Make computing more accessible to a young age range (K-5)
2. Make classroom-scale computing education cheaper
3. Inspire young learners to identify with the Maker identity

## Project Status
Currently, this project is in the **research** phase. We are conducting a wide sweep of academic literature on the topic of tangible computing and assessing the potential solution's feasibility. If you have interest in the project please reach out.
